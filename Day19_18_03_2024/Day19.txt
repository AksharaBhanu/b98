TestNG Groups

When we execute using testng.xml --> it will run all test methods--> full regression testing

execute selected test cases which belongs req groups --> regional regression testing
--> include/ exclude
--> every time to be run--> alwaysRun=true
--> dont run--> enabled=false

What is the default execution status of TestNG test
PASSED

How to change it to FAILED?
using Assert.fail();

all methods in Assert is static
all methods of Assert is overloaded

what happens if Assert fails?
it will not execute remaining code of the current test (other methods will be executed)


Diff 		Assert & 			SoftAssert
1. all methods are static			1. non-static
2. if fails, it will break test			2. it will continue test
3. we do not call assertAll			3. we must call assertAll at the end
4. basic & critical feature			4. others 



we have 600 tests , out of which 25 is failed, how do rerun only those failed tests?

-> we can re-run only failed tests using 'testng-failed.xml' present test-output folder

we can send data from testng.xml to any method present in TestNG class

parallel
none
methods
classes
tests


Homework: run script on chrome edge and firefox at the same time
